# Tax Credit Project

## A tool to streamline and promote charitable giving in New Zealand by combining a tax calculator with a tax credit calculator.

A work in progress that aims to: 

* Guide users towards getting a tax refund at the end of the year for their charitable donations
* Inspire users to donate more
* Promote effective giving
* Support hypothetical donation targets
* Provide accurate information, both in terms of the calculator and in terms of summarising the process
* Provide references to official information
