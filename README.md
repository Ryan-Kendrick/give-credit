# Tax Credit Project

* Guide users towards getting a tax refund at the end of the year for their charitable donations
* Inspire users to donate more
* Promote effective giving
* Support hypothetical donation targets
* Provide accurate information, both in terms of the calculator and in terms of summarising the process
* Provide references to official information
